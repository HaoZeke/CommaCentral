Doubt
Once on a blank ruled page,Â 
She tried scribbling a form...
Matching some broken lines
A lame creation, hence born!!

To all who saw, it made no sense,
The folk, the people, her cohorts so close.
She smiled a smile weird and unknown,
Faithful rendering of her enigmatic prose!

She held the paper in her hands,
Swayed a little, the smile was constant
She laid it down and glued her stare,
Puzzled or amazed? She missed something important...

Holding a pen, she sat down again
A little disturbed, a little crestfallen
The smile she had was now lost,
About this pain, she did mention often!

She drew and drew, hours and days
Passed by unnoticed in front of her...
She still drew, and yes it was now complete,
For the world to see, her eyes now blur.

She left the form on its own,
Took a corner, lost and abandoned...
Saw those people marvel and appreciate,
Trying to convince, like it never happened!!
