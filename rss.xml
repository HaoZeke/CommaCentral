      <description>Once on a blank ruled page, 
She tried scribbling a form...
Matching some broken lines
A lame creation, hence born!!

      <title>आज भी वही अहसास है</title>
      <link>http://haozeke.github.io/CommaCentral//hindi-poem-vats-one</link>
      <description>खुशियों  की सौगात है,
प्यार की बरसात है,
एक धुंधला सा चेहरा, पर आँखों  में साफ है,
इन वीरान गलियों में भीड़ सी लग जाती है,
तेरी याद तो दिल के पास है , तेरी याद जो दिल के पास है।
तुझे समझ के भी समझ न सकी,
तेरी दोस्ती को पहचान न सकी,
क्या यह मेरी हार है?
या सच्ची दोस्ती की यहीं  शुरुआत है?
अपनी दोस्ती से तेरे चेहरे पर मुस्कान न ला सकी।
पर मेरी मुस्कान तेरी खुशियों  पे निसार है,
कुछ अनकही बाते लफ़्ज़ों के ताले में कैद हो गयी,
पर दिल के दरमियाँ आज भी कही वह दोस्ती लेती साँस है,
आज भी वही अहसास है,
आज भी वही अहसास है।

      <title>The Businessman &amp; the fisherman</title>
      <link>http://haozeke.github.io/CommaCentral//the-businessman-and-fisherman</link>
      <description>An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor’s orders. Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.

      <title>The Purpose of Education</title>
      <link>http://haozeke.github.io/CommaCentral//the-purpose-of-education</link>
      <description>As I engage in the so-called &quot;bull sessions&quot; around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the &quot;brethren&quot; think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.

      <title>Out to Sea</title>
      <link>http://haozeke.github.io/CommaCentral//out-to-sea</link>
      <description>I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me, or to any other. I may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale.

      <title>Looking-Glass house</title>
      <link>http://haozeke.github.io/CommaCentral//looking-glass-house</link>
      <description>One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:— it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn’t have had any hand in the mischief. 
The way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr — no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good. 
But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle.

      <title>Down The Rabbit Hole</title>
      <link>http://haozeke.github.io/CommaCentral//down-the-rabbit-hole</link>
      <description>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, 'and what is the use of a book,' thought Alice 'without pictures or conversation?'
