	     <h1>Doubt</h1>
<p>Once on a blank ruled page,Â <br />
She tried scribbling a form&#8230;<br />
Matching some broken lines<br />
A lame creation, hence born!!</p>
<p>To all who saw, it made no sense,<br />
The folk, the people, her cohorts so close.<br />
She smiled a smile weird and unknown,<br />
Faithful rendering of her enigmatic prose!</p>
<p>She held the paper in her hands,<br />
Swayed a little, the smile was constant<br />
She laid it down and glued her stare,<br />
Puzzled or amazed? She missed something important&#8230;</p>
<p>Holding a pen, she sat down again<br />
A little disturbed, a little crestfallen<br />
The smile she had was now lost,<br />
About this pain, she did mention often!</p>
<p>She drew and drew, hours and days<br />
Passed by unnoticed in front of her&#8230;<br />
She still drew, and yes it was now complete,<br />
For the world to see, her eyes now blur.</p>
<p>She left the form on its own,<br />
Took a corner, lost and abandoned&#8230;<br />
Saw those people marvel and appreciate,<br />
Trying to convince, like it never happened!!</p>
